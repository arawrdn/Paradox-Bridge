# Paradox-Bridge
dApp that simulates token transfer between EVM and Solana chains,without actually moving assets. It mirrors token states in two smart contracts, creating the illusion of a seamless crosschain bridge. The web interface lets users connect EVM or Solana wallets, view token balances, and “bridge” tokens through synced contract state updates.
